# PEAK-Performance

working on a description... but i cannot share the data, but here is the top row of the CSV file in case you where wondering (order doesn't matter, the only required one is Date and Name, all others can be changed):

'Date','Name','System Weight', 'Jump Height', 'Braking RFD','Time To Takeoff','mRSI', 'Peak Relative Propulsive Power'
 
Using this program you can get all kind of statistical data from the teams as well as releant graphs for the teams as well as individuals where you can get the individual graphs for the whole academic year, a specific season (pre-season, post-season, or season), and look at the trend of the data using a polynamial regresion. In this graph I also included the Minimal Detectable Change (MDC), which represents the range where we can observe a statistical significant change in the data.

still working on the project, currenlty working on the team analysis code...
