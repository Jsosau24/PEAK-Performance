# PEAK-Performance

working on a description... but i cannot share the data but here is the top row of the CSV file in case you where wondering (order doesn't matter):

'Date','Name','System Weight', 'Jump Height', 'Braking RFD','Time To Takeoff','mRSI', 'Peak Relative Propulsive Power'
 
you ca use the MDC graph test to see what kind of graphs you can make with this information you can also change the vairbales if that is something you want to
